## Overview
I hail from a very large family on my mother's side: the LeCours family. She had 13 siblings, which amounted to 42 cousins in my generations, and many more in subsquent generations. Since I was young, my Mom & I would annually print a family calendar containing birthdays and anniversaries, along with a booklet containing contact info for each family member. These distributions were always, and continue to be, a test of my technical prowess. Hence, in 2018, I thought it was time to migrate that data to the web, so we could keep it constantly updated. I build this website for that purpose.

## Developmment Philosophy
