## Welcome Message
__Welcome to LeCoursville__

Merry Christmas LeCoursville! In an effort to keep our calendar and directory content current, we're hosting this website for everyone to access the data on-demand. You can view the info online, then download or print it using the corresponding buttons in the top right. Please excuse the bugs: this app is still rough around the edges.

If you have content or feature suggestions, please email me at efournier92@gmail.com. we'll continue to add new features regularly, so check back again soon!
